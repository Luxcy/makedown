# Emphasis  

To create bold or italic, wrap with asterisks * or underscores _.  

To avoid creating bold or italic, place a backslash in front \* or \_.  

# Paragraphs  

A paragraph is consecutive lines of text with one or more blank lines between them.  

For a line break, add either a backslash \ or two blank spaces at the end of the line.  

# Headings  

Starting a line with a hash # and a space makes a header.  

# Links  

Links can be either inline with the text, or placed at the bottom of the text as references.  

Link text is enclosed by square brackets [], and for inline links, the link URL is enclosed by parens ().  

# Images  

Images are almost identical to links, but an image starts with an exclamation point !.  

# Code  

To create inline code, wrap with backticks `.  

To create a code block, either indent each line by 4 spaces, or place 3 backticks ``` on a line above and below the code block.  

# Lists  

Unordered lists can use either asterisks *, plus +, or hyphens - as list markers.  

Ordered lists use numbers followed by period . or right paren ).  
# Nested Lists  

To nest one list within another, indent each item in the sublist by **four spaces**. You can also nest other elements like paragraphs, blockquotes or code blocks.
